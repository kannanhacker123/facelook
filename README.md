# FaceLook ðŸ˜„ðŸŽ¥

A fun and practical OpenCV project for learning face recognitionâ€”with a splash of humor and AI charm!

---

## What is FaceLook?

**FaceLook** is a Python-based facial recognition app designed for hands-on exploration. Register your face, train a recognition model, and recognize faces in real time using your webcam. If a stranger appears, FaceLook responds with a random programming joke!

---

## Features

- **Register Faces:** Collect face images from your webcam for each user
- **Train Model:** Train an LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) face recognition model
- **Real-Time Recognition:** Detect and identify known faces live; strangers get greeted with a joke!
- **Voice Feedback:** Friendly spoken messages using `pyttsx3`
- **Fun Touches:** Playful console UI and jokes for a lighthearted experience

---

## Use Cases

- **Attendance System:** Touchless logging for students, employees, etc.
- **Home Security / Access Control:** Recognize family or guests, trigger actions
- **Personalized Smart Displays:** Greet users, show weather/schedules
- **Small Business Enhancer:** Remember returning customers and preferences (with consent)
- **Interactive Installations:** Trigger art or animations for recognized or new faces

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Pickle
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kannanhacker123/facelook.git
    cd facelook
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

Run the app:

```sh
python face-rec.py
```

You'll see:

```
=== FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM ===
1. Collect Face Data
2. Train Model
3. Start Recognition
4. Exit
```

### Workflow

1. **Collect Face Data:**  
   Select option 1, enter a name, and let the webcam capture your face.

2. **Train the Model:**  
   Choose option 2 to train the LBPH model with your collected faces.

3. **Start Recognition:**  
   Option 3 activates real-time recognition. Known users are greeted by name, unknown faces get a programming joke.

## Project Structure

```
facelook/
â”œâ”€â”€ face-rec.py          # Main application logic
â”œâ”€â”€ safe_filename.py     # Utility for safe folder/file naming
â”œâ”€â”€ faces/               # Directory storing face data
â”œâ”€â”€ lbph_model.yml       # Trained face recognition model
â”œâ”€â”€ labels.pkl           # Name-label mappings
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
```

## Shortcuts & Tips

- **Press `q`** â€“ Quit face data collection or recognition
- **Press `r`** â€“ Retrain the model live with new data during recognition
- Face images are saved in the `faces/` directory
- Models are saved as:
    - `lbph_model.yml` (model file)
    - `labels.pkl` (label mapping)
