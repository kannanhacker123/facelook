#  FaceLook

> A fun and practical OpenCV project to learn face recognition â€” with a splash of humor and AI charm!



FaceLook is a Python-based facial recognition app built for learning and exploration. It allows users to register their faces, train a recognition model, and then recognize faces in real time using a webcam. If a stranger appears, the app responds with a random programming joke!


---

# Features

## Register Faces â€“ Collect face images from your webcam for each user.

## Train Model â€“ Train an LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) face recognition model on collected data.

## Real-Time Recognition â€“ Detect and identify known faces live; strangers get greeted with a joke!

## Voice Feedback â€“ Friendly spoken messages using pyttsx3.

## Fun Touches â€“ Playful console UI and jokes to keep things light.

# Use Cases

## Attendance System

How it works: Register individuals (students, employees, etc.), then automatically log their attendance with timestamps.

Benefit: Touchless, fast, and more accurate than manual systems.


## Home Security / Access Control

Recognize family or guests and trigger actions like unlocking doors or sending alerts.


## Personalized Smart Displays

Show personalized greetings, weather, or schedule based on whoâ€™s in front of the webcam.


## Small Business Enhancer

Recognize returning customers and remember preferences (with consent).


## Interactive Installations

Trigger art or animations based on recognized or new faces.

ðŸš€ Usage

Run the app:

```python
python face-rec.py
```
You'll see:

=== FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM ===
1. Collect Face Data
2. Train Model
3. Start Recognition
4. Exit

# Workflow

1. Collect Face Data
Select option 1, enter a name, and let the webcam capture your face.


2. Train the Model
Option 2 will train the LBPH model using the collected faces.


3. Start Recognition
Option 3 activates real-time face recognition. Known users are greeted by name, and unknown faces get a programming joke.

# Shortcuts & Tips

Press q â€“ Quit face data collection or recognition.

Press r â€“ Retrain the model live with new data during recognition.

All face images are saved in the faces/ directory.

Models are saved as:

lbph_model.yml (model file)

labels.pkl (label mapping)
